# CanvasSync
This script parses all files and folders for selected courses from Canvas and downloads all new files that previously have not been downloaded. For best results, sync classes into Google Drive for access across all devices!

## Features
When run for the first time, a guided setup starts with prompts to:
1. Input authorization token
2. Select courses for syncing
3. Select sync destination for each course
